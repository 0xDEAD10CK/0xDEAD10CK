Kia Ora! Greetings!

My name is Josh and I am a recent graduate of\
the Bachelor's of Information Technology at Otago\
Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand.

My current focus language is Python and looking to\
get into Software and Applications Development as\
a career.

My belief is that any coding project that eventually\
goes untouched, was not a waste of time, but full of\
learning opportunities. I don't think tons of unfinished\
projects is a bad thing, I think it shows willingness\
to experiment and to try new things.


```python
# A developer Haiku
You learn as you make
Never stop making my friend
def improve(self)
```
